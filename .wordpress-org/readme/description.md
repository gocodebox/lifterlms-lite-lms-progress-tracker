**Lite LMS Progress Tracker** by [LifterLMS][home] is a lightweight block plugin that allows users and visitors to track their progress through content on your website.

With a simple and customizable "Mark Complete" button, you can add progress tracking to any post or page on your site!

You can even link the "Mark Complete" buttons anywhere you like to create learning paths, tracks, or courses through your website content.

Think of it as a lightweight Learning Management System (LMS) for a website project that isn't ready yet for all the advanced functionality in a full featured WordPress LMS plugin.
